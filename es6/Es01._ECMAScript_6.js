/*
  ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification
created to standardize JavaScript.
  
 The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6
(ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, adds
significant new syntax for writing complex 
applications, including 
👉classes and modules, 
👉iterators and for/of loops,
👉generators, 
👉arrow functions, 
👉binary data,
👉typed arrays, 
👉collections (maps, sets and weak maps),
👉promises,
👉number and
👉math enhancements, 
👉reflection, and proxies.

 In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript 
(ES5). The reason that ES6 became so popular is
that it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts
such as classes.
